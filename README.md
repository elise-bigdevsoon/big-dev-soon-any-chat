# Task
Build a Calculator Application as presented in the design under the Calculator project section in BigDevSoon. The project itself combines a gentle UX/UI and covers some math operations that you will need to implement in order to create a working Calculator. As an additional feature, you can try implementing a Light/Dark mode toggle. Good luck! ðŸŽ‰

## Prerequisites
You can choose any technologies of your own preference, the same applies to any tools, libraries, frameworks and everything related. We want you to have fun building this project and composing a technology stack that plays well with your taste.

## Requirements

- [ ] Calculator UI matches the design and has a straightforward UX.
- [ ] Calculator should be initialized with 0.
- [ ] Users should be able to input numbers and execute all of the available math operations.
- [ ] Users should be able to get the correct result by pressing the `=` operator.
- [ ] Users should be able to add a decimal by pressing the `.` operator.
- [ ] AC button should clear all previous & incoming operations as well as reset the calculator to 0.
- [ ] C button should only delete the last operation.
- [ ] Previous operations should be shown above the output value.
- [ ] Calculator shouldn't allow a number to begin with multiple zeros.
- [ ] Cover any additional edge cases that might happen.
- [ ] Implement Light & Dark Mode.
- [ ] Improve UX/UI by adding error handling and some hover effects, animations, and/or transitions.
- [ ] Add unit tests by e.g. using jest.

## Deployment
Once you are ready with the project and unlocked the Complete step, you can try deploying the project to Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages. One important thing to remember is that we've added a `<bds />` tag to the `index.html` file and will do a check against it while trying to add a Project URL. Don't forget it! ðŸ˜Š
